I have been developing for screens since I hijacked the family's first computer and got a hold of an AOL floppy disk. Always prone to organizing, improving and making things just look good. 

I began my professional career in video games at Midway where I developed online marketing materials to promote and educate people about our games, like Mortal Kombat and NFL Blitz. I even created box art for MK: Armageddon. It spoiled me for life. But it also instilled a sense of fun into everything I do. 

The practice of UX seeks to get a job done in a logical and efficient manner. But it also envelops the emotional and personal relationship a user has with a product. My professional goal is to create things that are highly usable _and_ enjoyable to use.

If you'd like to see a history of employment, edudation and accolades---please take a look at my profile on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/n8peters/">LinkedIn</a>. It is the most up-to-date source for those sorts of things.
