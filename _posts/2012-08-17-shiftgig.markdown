##From Startup to Corporate
I've been working with Shiftgig for two years now. In that time I have helped evolve the original site into a mobile-friendly, fully-responsive experience. 

I've helped streamline the application process, improved job-posting tools for managers, created effective user profiles and developed several marketing partnership experiences with industry brands including New Castle, Smirnoff and Hangar 1.

Users put the results in down-to-earth terms

    I think Shiftgig is easy to use. Once you add all your information in, it's really easy to apply to a bunch of jobs. I think it's cool; I like it.

    I really, really like the site. It seems really simple and easy to navigate. I have already received my first job invitation with-in the first two days of signing up. So far, so good.
