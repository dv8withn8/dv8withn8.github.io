The most difficult part of putting together a porfolio is compiling and documenting all the work you've done in a given period of time. The fun part is building it.

Recently I've discovered the magic of GitHub Pages, powered by Jekyll. Is there a better way to do a portfolio? Dig into <a href="http://github.com/dv8withn8">my repo</a> to view this site's source code. I only wish I could share the code written for private repos.
