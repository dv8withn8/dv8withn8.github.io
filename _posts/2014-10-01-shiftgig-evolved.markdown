##Modern Framework, Modern UI
Shiftgig was (is) originally built on Drupal 7. This worked for a time but as business needs grew and changed, so did our technology. We had previously proven ourselves capable of a JS/API driven front-end with our internal Bullpen tools. Now the time has come to take what we learned with those projects and apply it to our rapidly aging Shiftgig platform. We're starting with the job boards they will be _awesome_.
