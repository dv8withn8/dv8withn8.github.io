Shiftgig is finally, _officially_, headed down the rebrand road after putting our efforts fully behind the current business model. As part of this effort I lead the visual efforts in creating a new logo and refreshed our website with a new visual language to compliment it. It's been a culmination of ideas that have been bubbling inside of me for the better part of a year and it was with relief that I was able to make much of it a reality.
 
We ended up with something fresh, unique and ultimately better reflects who we are, what we do and what we believe. Every color, typeface, scale, proportion, etc was chosen with a specific purpose and meaning. It was a designer's dream project and I am immensely proud of it. I also hope to continue watch it evolve and expand  into something that is a simple joy on the surface but beneath, a complex system of purpose and intent.
