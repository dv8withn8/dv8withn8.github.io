I have been developing for screens since I hijacked the family's first computer and got a hold of an AOL floppy disk. Always curious, I wanted to learn what made this Internet thing tick and began creating websites of my own at 13. 

I began my professional career in video games at Midway where I developed online marketing materials to promote and educate people about our games, like Mortal Kombat and Blitz: The League. I even created box art for MK: Armageddon. It spoiled me for life--but it also instilled a sense of fun into everything I do. I have worked in the agency world, freelanced and helped shape successful startup so far and I eagerly await the next challenge.

If you'd like to see a history of employment, education and accolades---please take a look at my profile on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/n8peters/">LinkedIn</a>. It is the most up-to-date source for those sorts of things.
