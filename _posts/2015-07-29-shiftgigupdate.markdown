##Shiftgig, The Pivot

I've been with Shiftgig for 3 years. In that time, I've watched this startup grow from a dozen people crammed into 200sq feet in an incubator to a company over 100 strong with offices across the country. Wow. People keep telling me this isn't what happens at startups.

We started out as a job board married to a profile and networking system for the hospitality industry. LinkedIn for the blue collar worker. We built a community, curated content and partnered with global brands.

Then it all changed.

We had just relaunched our job search tools. A new framework, exciting location based & interactive searches that user tests showed people were digging. Then we quietly pushed all that to the background. The brand was refreshed and new homepage was launched declaring our new primary business model. Check it out.
